Hi Martin,

Sorry for the late reply.
Here is some explanation and answers from our R&D team.

YES

typedef struct _echoInfo
{
    unsigned int serNum1;
    unsigned int serNum2;
    int systemType;
    unsigned char accessCtrl;
    unsigned char workState;
    unsigned char haveHost;
    sockAddr_t udpAddr; //ip address
    char hostName[NAMELENGTH];
    char printerName[NAMELENGTH];
    char printerType[NAMELENGTH];
} echoInfo;

> (R2c) I then send a "GiveStatus" message to the printer. I have no idea what the 73 bytes in this message mean.

> (R2e) After one StatusMessage, I close the connection and wait 10seconds, and then redo these 5 steps. This allows me to use the official Cetus app on PC to e.g. send a STOP or PAUSE command.

YES

    short curHeight; //the height divide by 10, 847 represent 84.7mm

    unsigned int remainTime; //the lowest byte is percent of job,
    //the higher 3 bytes for remain time, unit second,
    //0x001B463 represent 99(63)% finished, remain 436(0X1B3) seconds

    //temperature of 1/2/3/4
    short temperature[4]; //divide by 50, 1050 =3D 21 degree
    char heaterOn; //bit 0 for heat1, bit1 for heat2, 0x05 represent heat1 and heat3 is opened

    unsigned char XXX[4];
    float XXXX[4];

    unsigned int outPort; //OUT/IN port status, every bit represent one port.

> (Q1) Is it ok to publish the ESP8266 sources on GitHub?

OK

OK
